# ELE 532: Signals and Systems I

**Institution:** Toronto Metropolitan University  
**Student:** Hamza Malik  
**Instructors:** Dr. Javad Alirezaie & Dr. Soosan Beheshti  
**Course Coordinator:** Dr. Javad Alirezaie  

## 📖 Course Description

Analyzes continuous and discrete-time signals and systems, covering Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) modeling, Laplace transforms, convolution integrals, Fourier analysis, transfer functions, and the fundamentals of signal sampling. The course emphasizes the mathematical foundations of frequency-domain analysis and the practical application of MATLAB/Simulink for system verification.
